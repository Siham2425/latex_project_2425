\begin{abstract}
This project endeavors to revolutionize sensor technology by integrating cutting-edge 2D materials like laser-induced graphene (LIG) with traditional conductive dyes, resulting in hybrid sensors adaptable to various surfaces. Furthermore, employing laser nanostructuring holds potential for refining electrode fabrication, particularly in biomedical contexts, offering a cost-effective solution for biopower electrode production. Leveraging nanolaser technology, this research aims to enhance monitoring procedures and manufacturing versatility. By harnessing graphene-derived biomaterials, the study seeks to develop nanostructured biomaterials with adjustable properties, addressing challenges in neurobiology and presenting potential applications in regenerative medicine.

\section{Background}
In recent years, the fields of sensors and biosensors have advanced significantly, propelled by innovations in nanoscience, electronics, and biotechnology. These technologies have notably enhanced the performance, sensitivity, selectivity, and portability of biosensors, rendering them indispensable in various domains such as medical diagnostics \cite{liu2022}, food safety, process control, and environmental monitoring \cite{paterakis2022}.

One pivotal advancement in sensor technology involves the utilization of carbon-based nanomaterials \cite{wang2019}, which are increasingly preferred due to their exceptional electrical conductivity, lightweight, and flexibility. These materials, including carbon nanofibers (CNF), carbon nanocrystals (CNC), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), demonstrate conductivity values ranging from 0.17 to $2\times10^{7}$ S/m \cite{wu2021}.

Graphene, along with its derivatives, is renowned for its extensive specific surface area and exceptional conductivity, attributes that have drawn significant scholarly attention. These properties facilitate enhanced electron transfer between biomolecules and sensor surfaces, rendering graphene \cite{kowalczyk2020} an ideal material for biosensing applications.
